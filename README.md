# RateMyClass
Internhacks Summer 2020 Cohort Project

This project was built to help college students in determining classes within their college system. Since colleges do not provide a high-detailed description on the different classes provided at the instition, we wanted to help college students find classes, as class schedules should not add further hardships in college. This website allows students to make reviews on specific classes and provide insights, such as difficulty level, applicability to industry and the workforce, average time studying, and more. Our overarching mission was to guide college students in determining their next quarter/semester class schedules and provide them with a holistic view of the overall course.
